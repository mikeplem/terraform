# RDS Bastion Server

I am testing the process to access an RDS database without needing a VPN or some other zero trust system. [AWS has documented this process](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/securely-connect-to-an-amazon-rds-or-amazon-ec2-database-instance-remotely-with-your-preferred-gui/) and I think this is an interesting way to use AWS native facilities to reach a database from a personal computer.
